## What is this?
This repository contains code for setting up your Project Zomboid dedicated server through cloud services (like AWS) effortlessly. 

## Motivation
Project Zomboid comes with its own hosting feature built into the client. However, it relies on one player to become the "host". 

I always found this frustrating when playing with my girlfriend. If I wanted to work on something whilst she's away or busy, I couldn't do that because she has to be there to start the server. To resolve this, PZ provides a dedicated server solution.

There are *tonnes* of dedicated hosting solutions out there; however, they can be very costly; especially when you don't even play PZ that much.

Setting up a server requires a lot of technical expertise and can be daunting to those without experience in cloud providers or other hosting services.

I was inspired by the effortless experience that Minecraft players have for their servers. The process for players is to simply register to a website, give their servers a name and configuration and press a big "start" button to create their server. I want that same experience for PZ players. 

In terms of how, I'm not sure. But that's what this is for. Feel free to join me in this journey.
